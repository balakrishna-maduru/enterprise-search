## ðŸŒ³ Modern Organization Chart - Debugging Summary

### Issue Identified:
The organization chart was only showing the target employee instead of the complete hierarchy tree from CEO down to the target employee.

### Root Cause:
The `isExpanded` state logic in the `OrgNode` component was preventing child nodes from rendering properly.

### Fix Applied:
1. **Removed expansion condition**: Changed from `{hasReports && isExpanded && (` to `{hasReports && node.reports && node.reports.length > 0 && (`
2. **Added debug information**: Included a debug panel showing the complete tree structure
3. **Enhanced logging**: Added console logs to track data flow

### Expected Result:
The org chart should now display:
- **CEO James Wilson** at the top
- **4 VPs** as direct reports (Sarah Chen, Michael Davis, Jennifer Martinez, Robert Brown)
- **Complete nested hierarchy** showing all levels down to the target employee
- **Highlighted target employee** (Emily Zhang) with yellow ring and badge

### Verification Steps:
1. Search for "Emily" in the application
2. Click "View Hierarchy" on Emily Zhang's profile
3. The org chart should show the complete 5-level hierarchy
4. The debug panel will show the tree structure for verification

### API Confirmed Working:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/employees/14/hierarchy" 
# Returns complete hierarchy from CEO with 4 direct reports
# Shows nested structure: CEO â†’ VPs â†’ Directors â†’ Managers â†’ ICs
```
